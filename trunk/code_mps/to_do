To Do(Not sure about order of priorities)

Critical

    Why do we do we get bad ratios for very sparse matrixes?(possibly negative coeffs we are missing)
    Why does our constant factor change with size?(vs version 2007)
    Compare against glpk and cplex.
    Why do we not have to scale at the end of the program?
    Fix overflow on timer.

High

    Count operations so we can make an accurate prediction of time correctly.
    When should we deleted constraints marked for deleting?(compress_forward)
    Why does least squares does not work for non-liner equations?
    Use real tomography data for tomography problems.
    Why does fastpc use so much memory?
    Ask around for big liner problems.(forums,glpk mailing list,??)
    Use random distributions for tests.

Medium
 
     Algorithm

	Parallel algorithm
     	Input fastpc solutions to simplex as a starting point.
	Could you use standard tomography algorithm to solve liner programs?
     	Heuristics

		Increment variables by a greater amount early in the algorithm
		Batch increments
		???

     Stability

	Initial check for input errors.

		Bad number of rows.
		Negative coefficients
		Incorrect types
		Overflows
		Variables not in any constraints

	Check for overflows on all operations
	Check returns from standard functions for error codes
	Run memory checker on fastpc
     
     Integration with glpk

     Stand alone functionality

     	     clean up repository
     	     code clean up
     	     documentation
	     packaging(fastpc and scripts)
     	     other objective functions
     	     covering
     	     scaling constraints
	     general interface 
	     api

     Some sort of write up on why repeated sampling works for random pair.
     Write up on why rounding errors in sampling are too small to make a difference.

Low

     non-liner programs
     packing+covering
