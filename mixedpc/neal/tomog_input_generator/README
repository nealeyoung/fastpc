To generate inputs and run tests execute the following command:
	python tomog_run.py <input_identifier> [env]

input_identifier: This is the prefix to filter the image files under ./images/ directory. All files that start with this string will be used to generate the input.

env: This is an optional argument. If specified, it should be one of the values in the env.properties file (refer to the ConfigParser package of python for syntax).

After the inputs are generated, available solvers will be run. Once all the solvers are finished, the solutions files will be used to create images.

There is no check for the accuracy of images, so they need to be verified manually at this point. (TODO: implement check on the value of each pixel)
