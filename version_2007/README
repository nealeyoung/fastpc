This directory contains the code for the implementation of the alg 
done by Christos and Neal in 2007 for the FOCS paper.

This implementation assumes the matrix entries are in {0,1},
so does not sort matrix rows or columns, and does not maintain
the u's (maximum row/column entry estimates), which are all 1.
Likewise, sampling is simpler since each u is 1.

For the 2007 implementation, we also have more code:
the gnu linear programming kit (simplex), test inputs 
and test input generators, and scripts to do runs and 
gather data.  As of July 2008 those are available at
the UCR CS svn repository: https://svn1.cs.ucr.edu/neal/fastpc .
