This directory contains the program fastpc, its code, and possibly some tests and test scripts.

Name: 

      fastpc(fast packing and covering)

Compiling: 
	   
	   To compile, type 'make'.
	   To change compile options modify the Makefile.include

Running: 

	 ./fastpc epsilon_factor constraint_file [sort_factor|]

Synopsis:

	fastpc approximately solves the packing or covering linear program(lp) contained in constraint_file. 


Problem type:

The lp must be scaled so each constraint equation is of the form
variable * coefficient + variable * coefficient ... + variable * coefficient <= 1
where each coefficient is a non-negative rational number.

fastpc approximatly maximizes the sum of the variables while satisfying all the constraints.

File Format:

     constraint_file is an ascii file that begins with a header line of the form:
     integer integer integer
     Where:
	The first integer is the number of constraints, i.e. rows in the lp matrix.
	The second integer is the number of variables, i.e. columns in the lp matrix.
	The third interger is the total number of coefficients for all constraints, i.e. nonzeros in the lp matrix.
     
     The rest of the file consists of one line per nonzero coefficient in the lp, where each line is of the form:
     integer integer float
     Where:
	The first integer specifies which constriant (row) contains the coefficient.
	The second integer specifies which variable (column)  the coefficient corresponds to.
	The float specifies the value of the coefficient.
Other arguments:

      epsilon_factor is a 0 < float < 1 that specifies the accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm will return a solution to the lp with an objective function value of at least the optimum value of the objective function for the lp multiplied by  (1 - epsilon_factor) with high probability (i.e. the algorithm gives a 1- epsilon_factor approximation).

      sort_factor is a float >= 1. When 1 is given the algorithm uses exact sorting for preprocessing coefficients. When a larger number is given an approximate sort is used, with the sort_factor being equal to the largest ratio of any two mis-sorted coefficints. This results in faster preprocessing but a slower run of the main algorithm. A version of radix sort is used for approximate sorting. It is useful only for very large, dense coefficient matrices (see runtime given in paper).


Run Time:
	preprocessing: n * log(n)
	When: sort_factor is equal to 1.
	Main algorthm:
	     (r+c)*log(n)/(epsilon_factor)^2
	Where:
		r is the number of constriants.
		c is the number of variables.
		n is the number of non_zeros.
	With high probability.

Output:

	The program outputs to std_out, with the main result being the objective value of the lp solution and the objective value of its dual solution. It also outputs a file called fastpc_solution that contains the value of each variable of the primal solution on a new line.
